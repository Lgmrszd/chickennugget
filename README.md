Chicken Nugget
==============

top 10 anime mistakes

Adds a chicken nugget. You craft it just like any other nugget, but instead of using a metal ingot, you use a real, live, chicken.

You can cook and eat them too, you monster.

Known limitations: Likely only works in vanilla crafting tables. There's not much I can do about this, sorry!
