You've heard of gold nuggets, bronze nuggets, copper nuggets, and iron nuggets. But have you heard of chicken nuggets?

They work exactly like other metal nuggets, but instead of using an ingot, you use a chicken. They are of course convertible back and forth between nuggets and chickens. Useful for, I dunno, chicken storage. You can cook and eat them too; they can be consumed much quicker than normal food.
